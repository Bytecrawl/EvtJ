EvtJ ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alevinval/EvtJ.svg?branch=develop)
====

EvtJ provides a foundation on top of the Java NIO library.
The NIO library provides, among other things, a multiplexed,
non-blocking I/O facility for writing scalable servers.

Plug your own Module into EvtJ and forget about handling
the tedious stuff.
